# JavaScript Promises

1. **What is a promise in JavaScript?**
   - A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

2. **How do you create a new promise in JavaScript?**
   - You can create a new promise using the `Promise` constructor. For example:
     ```javascript
     const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         // Your asynchronous code here
         if (/* async operation successful */) {
             resolve(/* result */);
         } else {
             reject(/* error */);
         }
     });
     ```

3. **Explain the difference between resolve and reject in a promise.**
   - `resolve` is used to fulfill a promise, i.e., when the asynchronous operation is successful, and `reject` is used to indicate that the promise should be rejected, i.e., when the asynchronous operation fails.

4. **How do you handle errors in a promise chain?**
   - You can use the `catch` method to handle errors in a promise chain. For example:
     ```javascript
     myPromise.then(result => {
         // Handle success
     }).catch(error => {
         // Handle error
     });
     ```

5. **Explain the purpose of Promise.all and Promise.race.**
   - `Promise.all` takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable rejects.
   - `Promise.race` takes an iterable of promises and returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects.

6. **How do you chain promises together?**
   - You can chain promises together using the `then` method. For example:
     ```javascript
     myPromise.then(result => {
         return anotherPromise;
     }).then(anotherResult => {
         // Handle anotherResult
     }).catch(error => {
         // Handle error
     });
     ```

7. **What is the difference between promises and callbacks?**
   - Promises are more composable and readable than callbacks. Promises also support chaining, error handling, and better handling of asynchronous operations.

8. **How do you convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function?**
   - You can convert a callback-based function to a promise-based function using the `Promise` constructor. For example:
     ```javascript
     function callbackBasedFunction(callback) {
         // Asynchronous operation
         callback(/* result or error */);
     }

     function promiseBasedFunction() {
         return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
             callbackBasedFunction((result, error) => {
                 if (error) {
                     reject(error);
                 } else {
                     resolve(result);
                 }
             });
         });
     }
     ```

9. **How do you use async/await with promises?**
   - You can use the `async` keyword to define an asynchronous function and the `await` keyword to wait for a promise to resolve. For example:
     ```javascript
     async function myAsyncFunction() {
         try {
             const result = await myPromise;
             // Handle result
         } catch (error) {
             // Handle error
         }
     }
     ```

10. **How do you handle multiple asynchronous operations with promises?**
    - You can use `Promise.all` to handle multiple asynchronous operations concurrently. For example:
      ```javascript
      const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];
      Promise.all(promises)
          .then(results => {
              // Handle results
          }).catch(error => {
              // Handle error
          });
      ```

11. **How do you handle multiple promises simultaneously?**
    - You can handle multiple promises simultaneously using `Promise.all`, which takes an iterable of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable rejects.

12. **Explain the difference between Promise.resolve and new Promise.**
    - `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise with the specified value, while `new Promise` creates a new promise object. `Promise.resolve` is often used to convert non-promises into promises, whereas `new Promise` is used for creating new asynchronous operations.

13. **How do you handle timeouts with promises?**
    - You can handle timeouts with promises by using `Promise.race` to race a promise with a timeout promise. For example:
      ```javascript
      const timeoutPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
              reject('Timeout');
          }, 5000);
      });

      Promise.race([myPromise, timeoutPromise])
          .then(result => {
              // Handle success
          }).catch(error => {
              // Handle timeout or other errors
          });
      ```

14. **Can you chain catch statements in a promise chain?**
    - Yes, you can chain `catch` statements in a promise chain to handle errors at different stages of the chain. For example:
      ```javascript
      myPromise.then(result => {
          // Do something with result
      }).catch(error => {
          // Handle error
      }).then(() => {
          // Do something else
      }).catch(error => {
          // Handle error in the second then block
      });
      ```

15. **How do you handle race conditions with promises?**
    - Race conditions can be handled by ensuring that the order of operations is deterministic and does not depend on the timing or concurrency of asynchronous operations. Using `Promise.race` to race promises with different outcomes can also help manage race conditions.

16. **What is promise chaining and how does it work?**
    - Promise chaining is the practice of chaining multiple asynchronous operations together using the `then` method. Each `then` block returns a new promise, allowing you to chain multiple asynchronous operations in a sequence.

17. **How do you cancel a promise?**
    - Promises in JavaScript cannot be canceled once they are created. However, you can manage the behavior of a promise to simulate cancellation by not acting on its resolution if the cancelation condition is met.

18. **Explain the difference between then and catch methods in promises.**
    - The `then` method is used to handle the fulfillment of a promise, while the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that occur during the execution of the promise chain.

19. **How do you create a promise that resolves after a certain delay?**
    - You can create a promise that resolves after a certain delay using the `setTimeout` function. For example:
      ```javascript
      function delay(ms) {
          return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
      }

      delay(2000).then(() => {
          console.log('Promise resolved after 2 seconds');
      });
      ```

20. **How do you handle promise rejections?**
    - Promise rejections can be handled using the `catch` method or by passing a rejection handler to the `then` method. For example:
      ```javascript
      myPromise.then(result => {
          // Handle success
      }).catch(error => {
          // Handle error
      });
      ```
