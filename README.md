3. **What are the different types of HTML elements?**
   - HTML elements can be classified into several categories, including:
     - Structural elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`)
     - Text-level elements (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`)
     - Form elements (e.g., `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<select>`, `<textarea>`)
     - Multimedia elements (e.g., `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`)
     - Table elements (e.g., `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`)

4. **What is the purpose of the `<head>` tag in HTML?**
   - The `<head>` tag is used to contain meta-information about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other metadata. It is not displayed as part of the main content of the page.

5. **Explain the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`.**
   - The `<div>` and `<span>` elements are both used for grouping and applying styles to content, but they have different purposes:
     - `<div>`: Used for grouping block-level elements and creating sections of content.
     - `<span>`: Used for grouping inline elements and applying styles to specific parts of text or other inline content.

6. **What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag?**
   - The `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag is used to provide alternative text for an image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or if the user is using a screen reader.

7. **How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?**
   - To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the `<a>` (anchor) tag with the `href` attribute to specify the URL of the link. For example:
     ```html
     <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here</a>
     ```

8. **What is the purpose of the `<meta>` tag?**
   - The `<meta>` tag is used to provide metadata about the HTML document. This can include information such as the character encoding, viewport settings, author, description, and keywords for the page.

9. **Explain the difference between HTML and XHTML.**
   - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating web pages. XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a stricter, more XML-like version of HTML that follows the rules of XML syntax.

10. **What is the purpose of the `<form>` tag in HTML?**
    - The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for collecting user input. It can contain various form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.
